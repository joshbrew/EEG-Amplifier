## EEG Differential Amplifier

The main circuit here uses 4 low noise op amps to achieve EEG differential amplifications. The reference design is for 1000x gain at 5v with a 2.5v voltage reference. All calculations are in the pdf for your needs. If using battery power a voltage divider should work for a reference.
